# Analysis of Calcium propagation velocity in Heart-on-Chip devices

[Jupyter notebook](ca_analysis.ipynb) used for analyzing Calcium propgation velocities from high-speed video microscopy data. Analysis of aligned cardiac microtissues, cultured in a Heart-on-Chip shown.
Extracted profiles are used to compose Fig. S2 in [Schneider et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtbio.2022.100280).

### Purpose
Determine the signal onset time for each x-position along the muscle fiber. From the propagation along the fiber, the Calcium velocity is determined.

### Input
Video of fluorescence intensity, recorded at ~ 200 fps. Frames are saved as series of .tif-files in each folder.

### Output
Analysis in notebook produces following plots indicating the color-coded signal propagation and corresponding fit to determine the propagation velocity:
